# Programming project #2
This is the project that my friends and I are making to pass the second semester of the programming class at my university. The project is about writing a program using object oriented programming paradigm. We chose to write a game where the player controls a tank and uses it to shoot enemy tanks while protecting the base (denoted by an eagle) from being destroyed.

This project is not yet complete.

I will (probably) add a more elaborated readme when we finish this.

**Note: If you are running Windows (other systems are not supported right now), you should run your build tools with administrator privileges because there is a post-build step that creates a symlink near the executable to the directory that contains assets.**
